Question 1:
    My answer is item 2 because it maintains the symmetry of the upper and lower halves.

Question 2:
    My answer is item 2 because it maintains the increasing shape size from left to right

Question 3:
    My answer is item 3. The last image for each row is a combination of the two images before it.
    Item 3 is the only one that can be combined with another square to form the last image.

Question 4:
    My answer is item 4. Based on the progression on each row, the square and the circle move left/right
    while the line moves up/down. When the objects intersect, they will swap colors. Based on those
    observations, the expected image will have the line at the top, the circle is white and is on the
    right side, and the square is black and is on the left side.

Question 5:
    My answer is item 3. Based on the progression of images for each row, the square moves left to right,
    and the circle moves from bottom to top. Based on that observation, the circle and square should
    end up on the same position.
